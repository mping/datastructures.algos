# Queue

A queue is a data structure where elements are normally ordered in a First-In, First-Out fashion.
Normally, a queue supports `offer` for adding elements, `poll` for removing elements, and `peek` for inspecting.


A queue that supports insertion and removal at both ends is called a `Deque` (pronounced "deck").
Queues can be implemented with array-based structures or linked-list based structures.
Arrays are more efficient at the cost of code complexity.
