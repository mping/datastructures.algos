# Stack

A stack is a collection where the elements get stacked on top of each other. Unlike a queue which is normally 
First-In, First-Out (FIFO), the stack is Last-In, First-Out (LIFO). Stacks normally have `push`, `pop` and `peek`
which work like Array `add` to end, `remove` from tail, and `get` last - Stacks are normally implemented with an 
array-like data structure.

Stacks are useful for storing function call information (hence the famous Stack Overflow Exception), parenthesis balancing, applying
undo operations, Depth-First Search style traversal of trees, etc.
